# Hello Hacker
### If you have ended up here, you noticed something is very wrong, or you are looking for hardware support that no one else has.

And I welcome you.



# What is SuckerPunch Foundries?

X8X, the shorthand, is a text joke on FacePunch Studios logo.
SuckerPunch itself is the message we send.

In a way you could call us renegades, wanting to run machines and systems that not everyone has anymore, either because its what we have, or its what we like.  However, it is good to remember that not everyone has the newest systems, and to ignore that is vitriol at its finest.



# What do you do?

Research, mostly.  Much of the work that goes into what we do is in an effort to learn more about how it works, how to repair it, and how to make it easier to manage for other people, whatever it is.



# What sort of hardware?

X86-32, Itanium, PowerPC BE (32/64), i528 and related chips (Pent 4, Pent M), Pentium 3/2/1, Sparc, Arm32, and many other architectures.



# Uh, Why?

I want you to put yourself in the place of @awilfox, a developer that WOULD have an insulin pump.... had any of the current devs out there bothered to keep Arm32 up to date.

Hacker, theres a modern issue that we face where we are quickly approaching the inability to manage our own lives.  Insulin pumps, cars, and even your own computer.  Not only is there good reason to install 1vyrain on your thinkpad, there is good reason to NOT buy that new M3 macbook, as much as I want one too.



# ??????

In a world where we barely use 10GB files, we have systems capable of addressing crazy amounts of data, but no one end user has the ability to use all the power their hardware has.  We replace good code with more resources, and hardly fix the problems at hand.  Take Valve's source engine for instance, or the absolute spaghetti code that had to be rev-enged in Mario 64 just to get the game over 20FPS.  Now it runs at 60, on almost anything.  Its basically the new doom.



# So you're crazy?

I mean probably, but knowing many people that are stranded in places like Africa, Greenland, even in Alaska, where tech doesn't move in big quantities, new or old....  Someone has to do the support somewhere.



# So what is the main goal?

Currently?  Get Void PowerPC running again under a new name:  VoidPOWER, shorthand vP.  Power to the People.  Running on as many architectures as possible, and as the basis for more projects.

To document any hardware seen as useable, and inventory what parts can be gotten, and if none are found, to create new schematics to build new parts (Ex: Gas Plasma Displays / LCD Replacement units)

To research, itemize, and hack, every, single, interesting thing that is considered junk (Ex: Grid K2 as a desktop GPU, piped to Intel igpu, one GPU for games, one GPU for streaming)

To create a new form of Market out of spite in order to completely uproot the current expectations made by corporations and companies, completely user driven.

and

To spread as much anti-propaganda as possible, by any and all means necessary, for any and all means necessary.

You will never convince me that your OS is good if it can't detect netbook ACPI SSDT and DSDT tables.
You will never convince me that your system is superior if it is not as fast, snappy, moddable, and applicable as Adelie Linux, Void Linux, or SLiTaz.
And
For as long as I live, for as long as systems like Kolibri exist, you will never, ever, whatsoever, convince me that your install base needs to be over 4GB.

X8X will always work to better utilize resources, and teach as many people as possible how to do the same.  If nothing else, it will be in a pure effort of true self-independance for all.



# That sounds wack

Then you're part of the problem.
