# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @X8X-XZDX

### I am guessing this is some microsoy employee's blog tool now, but no matter really.  

# My name doesn't matter, but my origins do.  

I was a member of Tek Syndicate back before the corporate hell hole of Level1Techs ruined one of the last great webforums, and one of few that correctly
used its preferred forum software.  But its gone so far to the back of my mind I don't remember the name of it, or really care anymore.  Point is, my
projects used to be based on that forum.

Because of recent events, I am abandoning that board.  They are much too close to reddit at this point, quite literally in business and in social space.

# Current Projects

## Void POWER
##### POWER TO THE PEOPLE

QUITE LITERALLY.  This started as a PPC port, with a little and big endian port each.  However, I have a new plan.  Because of what happened to the previous
project (It got hijacked and trashed by @Q66), the new project not only is going to support BE and LE PowerPC / POWER, but I am going to be a pedantic asshole
about allowing other usergroups to run the OS.  Specific to Void POWER there will be a few tools to allow for unified group building over P2P networks, tools /
menus to allow for easily made user-hosted repositories and "Build Parties", and many other features that I have yet to announce.

As of now I only have PPC BE machines, though technically I guess my PS3 is LE.  My G4 and G5 based macs are all I got for now, so I am doing what I can with
what I have.  However, I want to get a full Talos 2 with dual 22 core La Grange CPU's, 256GB of ram, and hopefully a built out network for it to use.  I might
need to colo it though, IDK yet.  I have asked Raptor for compute time, but no reply yet.

For now, I will be continuing the original Void PPC project under the name Void POWER, and now with the express goal of allowing Void to be run on more platforms.
Theres a short list of platforms I would like to make Void available on, but until the repo is up I'll save that for later.  We will be starting with POWER as
thats what was last worked on, and attempt picking up ARM later on.  These are the two platforms I am personally interested in, so they are what I will be supporting.
However, if a user has an interest in a platform, there will be tools to help port.

Other plans include: Plan 9 integrations (WIP), P9 GRID NET, BTFS, User Scripts / PreConfigurations, Multiple Desktops Available w/ ISO, and more that I
don't care about bcause its 4AM and I'm working a 3rd in a gas station right now...
